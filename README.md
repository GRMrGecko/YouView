This is a program I started off closed source as it was one of my first programs and have released into the open source realm because I don't have much time to work on it.

In-order to compile properly, you should have a machine (virtual or real) which runs Mac OS X 10.8.x and install Xcode according to my scripts at https://github.com/GRMrGecko/Xcode-Scripts to add support for compiling for old machines.

I plan to possibly work on adding some of the features that used to exist one by one slowly. But I also want to start a new project which will also be open source which I will call MotiOnline. The difference will be that MultiOnline will just be a app that acts as a framework for plugins which adds support for video services and the program will not support older systems which is one of the main features of YouView (supporting 10.4.11-10.10+).

If you have any issues, try to fix it yourself or send me an email/submit an issue here.
