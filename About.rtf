\cf0 YouView Uses {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://ffmpeg.org"}}{\fldrslt FFmpeg}} for converting video, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://mediainfo.sourceforge.net"}}{\fldrslt mediainfo}} to determine information about video, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://sparkle.andymatuschak.org"}}{\fldrslt Sparkle}} for software update, and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/"}}{\fldrslt GData}} for gathering information.\
\
Browse, watch, convert, and download YouTube videos on your Mac faster, because YouView uses the core technologies of Mac OS X to play instead of Flash allowing video to run smoother on systems with lower specs.\
YouView contains great parental controls that'll allow any parents control what their children see on YouTube via filters such as Safe search and flagged videos. By default YouView is moderate on parental controls but can be strict if needed.\
YouView allows you to choose the max size of video that is loaded such as 1080P. By default it is 480P but can go all the way up to 4k if you system supports it.\
When logged in with YouView you have the ability to view your special feeds such as recommendations which shows videos that YouTube thinks you may also like based on your history of viewing.\
There is a lot more to YouView than described here, the best way to find out what you can do is to try it out your self.\
I require donations for download/converting of video as it isn't an easy task to get together.}
